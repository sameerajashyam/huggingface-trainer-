# ðŸŽ“ Student Math Score Predictor â€” PyTorch + Gradio

A deep learning model that predicts a student's math exam score based on demographic features.  
Built with **PyTorch**, deployed using **Gradio**, and ethically audited for **fairness across gender, race, and socio-economic background**.

> ðŸ§  Model architecture uses `nn.ModuleList` for dynamic layer stacking.  
> ðŸ“Š Fairness audit performed via group-wise error metrics â€” no sensitive columns used during training.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Build an interpretable, ethical, and deployable AI model that can predict student performance (math scores) using only demographic context.  
This includes checking whether the model is biased towards or against any group.

**Goal:** Predict `math score`  
**Dataset:** [Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
